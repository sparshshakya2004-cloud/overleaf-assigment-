\textbf{Architecture} & All-in-one: All services (drivers, file system, memory) run in one kernel space. & Minimalist: Only essential services (IPC, scheduling) stay in the kernel; others run in user space. & Concurrency-focused: A design that allows multiple processes to enter and execute kernel code simultaneously. \\ \hline

\textbf{Performance} & Very Fast: Direct communication between services without context switching. & Slower: High overhead due to constant message passing (IPC) between components. & Efficient Multitasking: Reduces CPU idle time by allowing other tasks to run while one is blocked. \\ \hline

\textbf{Stability} & Low: If one driver (e.g., video) crashes, the whole system often crashes (Kernel Panic). & High: If a service crashes, it can be restarted without bringing down the entire OS. & Reliable: Prevents data corruption by ensuring simultaneous tasks don't overwrite shared data. \\ \hline

\textbf{Real-Life Example} & Linux or Traditional Unix. & QNX (used in car dashboards) or Minix 3. & Modern Desktop OSs: Most modern kernels (including Linux and Windows NT) are designed to be reentrant. \\ \hline

\subsection{Detailed Examples}

\subsubsection*{1. Monolithic Kernel: The "Grand Kitchen"}
Imagine a large restaurant kitchen where the chef, cleaners, and servers all work in the same open space. They can talk to each other instantly, making the service extremely fast. However, if the cleaner slips and falls, they might knock over the chef and the stove, shutting down the entire restaurant. \\

\textbf{Best For:} High-performance gaming, supercomputers, and servers.

\subsubsection*{2. Microkernel: The "Safety Vault"}
Think of a bank with separate rooms for every clerk. If one clerk makes a mistake or gets sick, the other rooms are isolated and remain open. Because they have to pass notes through small windows to talk (IPC), it is slower, but it's much safer. International Journal For Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) \\

\textbf{Best For:} Critical infrastructure like medical devices or military systems where a crash could be fatal. 


\subsubsection*{3. Reentrant Kernel: The "Multitasking Chef"}
Imagine a chef who is boiling pasta. Instead of standing still and staring at the pot for 10 minutes (blocking), the chef starts chopping vegetables while the pasta cooks. If the phone rings (an interrupt), the chef answers it, finishes the call, and goes back to exactly where they left off without ruining the food. \\

\textbf{Best For:} Ensuring your PC stays responsive (e.g., your mouse still moves) even while a heavy program is loading data from the disk.
